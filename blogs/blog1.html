              <p>
                This week marked the beginning of our mobile app development journey for SkillStack AI. 
                We focused on exploring React Native as our cross-platform solution and setting up the 
                development environment. The team spent considerable time evaluating the technology stack, 
                understanding best practices, and creating a solid foundation for the upcoming development phases.
              </p>
              <p>
                We established the basic project structure, configured essential development tools, and created
                initial mockups for the core screens. The exploration phase involved extensive research on
                component libraries, navigation patterns, and state management solutions that would best fit
                our application requirements.

              <h2 class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4 mt-5">My Contributions</h2>
              <p>
                As the lead mobile developer, I dedicated this week to setting up our React Native development
                environment and establishing the project architecture. I began by researching the most efficient
                way to structure our React Native application, particularly focusing on scalability and maintainability.
              </p>
              <p>
                I set up the initial repository with a clean folder structure that separates concerns and follows
                modern React Native best practices. This included configuring essential libraries such as React
                Navigation for routing, implementing a state management solution with Redux, and setting up
                TypeScript for type safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the challenges I faced was deciding on the right UI component library that would match our
                design needs while maintaining performance. After evaluating several options, I selected React Native
                Paper for its Material Design implementation and excellent documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I created several base components that will be used throughout the application,
                including buttons, input fields, and cards with consistent styling. These components follow our
                design system guidelines and will help maintain consistency across the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the end of the week, I had a functioning development environment with hot reloading, proper
                linting and formatting rules, and the ability to run on both iOS and Android simulators. The
                groundwork has been laid for the team to start implementing features in the coming weeks.
              </p>
