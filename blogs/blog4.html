              <p>
                The final week of March was marked by significant progress in preparing the SkillStack AI 
                mobile application for deployment. Based on the commit logs, the team focused on several 
                critical areas: fixing bugs, enhancing the UI for mobile responsiveness, integrating analytics, 
                and preparing the deployment configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key improvements included fixing quiz saving functionality, adding a new home page with developer 
                profiles, implementing proper user verification, and removing hardcoded URLs in favor of 
                environment variables. The team also enhanced the navigation experience and fixed various issues 
                related to authentication and CORS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The week culminated with the addition of Vercel configuration for deployment, setting the stage 
                for the app's official launch. Multiple deployment-related fixes were implemented to ensure a 
                smooth release process.

              <h2 class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4 mt-5">My Contributions</h2>
              <p>
                During this final week, I focused on several critical aspects of the mobile app to prepare it for 
                deployment. Looking at the commit logs from March 25-31, my contributions aligned with the team's 
                push toward finalizing the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my primary tasks was fixing the quiz functionality. I completely revamped the quiz saving 
                system, removing automatic persistence during generation and replacing it with a more user-friendly 
                approach where saving is explicitly initiated by the user. This involved creating a floating results 
                panel with a save option and improving the quiz review experience with better explanations and 
                handling of unanswered questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also dedicated significant effort to enhancing the mobile responsiveness of our application. 
                Specifically, I made the Infinite page fully responsive for mobile devices, ensuring that all 
                elements adapt properly to different screen sizes and orientations. This included optimizing 
                layouts, adjusting font sizes, and implementing proper touch interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security was another area I focused on. I implemented proper CORS handling for cookies and fixed 
                user verification issues that were causing accounts to be deleted prematurely. I also removed 
                hardcoded URLs throughout the codebase and replaced them with environment variables, making the 
                application more secure and easier to deploy to different environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the Reels feature, I implemented significant UI and animation improvements. This included 
                adding motion-based slide transitions, keyboard controls for navigation, and new visual components 
                like the DotPattern and Ripple effects. I also enhanced the quiz interaction within Reels by adding 
                animated answers and feedback, and moved to a single-screen layout for better user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I assisted with deployment preparation by adding configuration files for Vercel and 
                making necessary adjustments to ensure smooth deployment. This included fixing authentication 
                issues and ensuring proper API communication in the production environment.
              </p>
